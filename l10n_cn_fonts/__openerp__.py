    This module replaces the standard PDF Type1 fonts with TrueType fonts that have
    unicode characters for simplified Chinese.
    The module contains the VeraSansYuanTi.
    With this module you can continue to use the old font names in the templates,
    they will be replaced with the Vera Sans Yuan Ti font names every time before creating a pdf.
    If you wish to use your own fonts, you have to place them in addons/l10_cn_fonts directory and 
    replace the font name in the file __init__.py accordingly.
    This Module is based on GÃ¡bor Dukai module (base_report_Unicode)
